# urlshortner
This is a URL shortner service project. That converts long URLs into short urls. This takes the database record in MongoDB. Creates the endpoint of POST to send the request and GET endpoint for getting the request which will present the short url. 
The GET and POST request can be tested from Postman.
I have used here Nodejs framework.

### To start run the following command
`npm start`

### Screenshort
